California Housing Price Prediction  

Project Overview  
This project aims to predict housing prices using the  California Housing dataset, which replaces the deprecated  Boston Housing dataset . It employs  Linear Regression  and  Ridge Regression to analyze the relationship between various housing features and their impact on house prices.



Steps Followed in the Project  

 1. Data Loading and Exploration  
  The California Housing dataset** is loaded and converted into a structured format for analysis.  
  Statistical summaries and correlation analysis help in understanding the key factors influencing house prices.

 2. Data Preprocessing  
  Feature normalization** is performed to bring all variables to a common scale.  
  The dataset is split into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets to evaluate model performance.

 3. Model Building
  Linear Regression** is implemented to model the relationship between features and housing prices.  
  Ridge Regression** is introduced as a regularized alternative to prevent overfitting.  

 4. Model Evaluation 
  Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is used to measure the average prediction error.  
  RÂ² Score** is calculated to assess how well the model explains variance in housing prices.  

5. Data Visualization
  Correlation heatmap** helps identify significant relationships between features and prices.  
  Predicted vs Actual price plots** show how well the models perform.  
  Residual distribution analysis** evaluates model errors and identifies potential biases.  

6. Project Outcomes 
 The model effectively predicts housing prices with minimal error.  
 Ridge Regression demonstrates better performance in preventing overfitting.  
 The importance of key features like median income, house age, and location is highlighted.  



Conclusion  
This project successfully replaces the deprecated **Boston Housing dataset with California Housing data to analyze housing price trends. **Machine learning techniques like Linear and Ridge Regression** provide insights into the most influential factors affecting house prices.
